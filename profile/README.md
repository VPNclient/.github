---

**VPN Client** is a cross-platform VPN client supporting multiple cores and protocols.

## Key Features

- **Multi-protocol support**: Xray (VMess, VLESS, Reality, Shadowsocks, Trojan, SSH), OpenVPN, WireGuard, as well as SOCKS5/HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
- **Cross-platform**: Available for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **High performance**: Native functionality implemented in Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android), and critical components written in C++ and Golang ensure speed and stability.

## Architecture

VPN Client architecture is structured across several layers:

1. **VPNclient-engine**  
   The core engine for various platforms. Handles VPN setup and management, traffic routing, OS integration, and communication with VPN protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, Xray, etc.).

2. **Platform Wrappers:**
   - **[VPNclient-engine-flutter](https://github.com/VPNclient/VPNclient-engine-flutter)**  
     Flutter plugin using `MethodChannel` to interact with native code. Allows using VPNclient-engine in cross-platform Flutter apps.
   - **[VPNclient-engine-react-native](https://github.com/VPNclient/VPNclient-engine-flutter)**  
     React Native wrapper via `NativeModules`. Provides the same VPNclient-engine integration for React Native apps.

3. **VPN Client App**  
   A Flutter-based application utilizing the wrappers to manage VPN sessions and display connection status.
